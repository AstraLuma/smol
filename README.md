[SMoL -- Smol MOdpack Launcher](http://astro73.com/smol/)
=========================================================

A Minecraft launcher without a service, instead using modpack files.


Stand-alone Libraries
=====================
So there's a few pieces of code that should really live in their own package:

* `pyq`: A desktop application framework based on webview, aiohttp, websockets, and jQuery
* `dirge`: An asycnio-based dependency-injection library
